# ScoreboardImageProcessing
# Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the tracking and display of bowling scores by recognizing numbers on 7-segment displays of bowling alleys. Utilizing a neural network model and a logic-based approach, the system captures and updates the scores in real-time, displaying them in a tabular format. This facilitates better monitoring and understanding of the game progress.

# Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Neural Network Model: Developed on Google Colab
- Front-End: Flutter application

# Working Principle

The system operates by recognizing numbers at specified positions using the neural network model. It then stores these numbers in a list according to the defined logic. This process ensures accurate tracking of players' scores, even in the event of lane changes.

# Installation Guide

1. Streamer Module: Start by running the streamer.py file.
2. Application Module: Edit the app.py file to include the correct local IP address and run it.
3. Flutter Application: Finally, run the Flutter application and input the API endpoint specified in the app.py file.

# Usage

The system is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward. After setting up the streamer and application modules, the Flutter application will display the real-time scores. Ensure that all components are correctly configured and connected for seamless operation.
